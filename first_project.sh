#Goal:
#The goal of this exercise is to create a shell script that adds users to the same Linux system as the
#script is executed on.
#############The script:

#The script:

#	Enforces that it be executed with superuser (root) privileges. If the script is not executed with
#superuser privileges it will not attempt to create a user and returns an exit status of 1.
#	Prompts the person who executed the script to enter the username (login), the name for
#	Creates a new user on the local system with the input provided by the user.
#	Informs the user if the account was not able to be created for some reason. If the account is
#not created, the script is to return an exit status of 1.
#	Displays the username, password, and host where the account was created. This way the
#help desk staff can copy the output of the script in order to easily deliver the information to
#the new account holder.

# Script must be executed with SU priveleges only. Return exit status 1 if executed not under ROOT
